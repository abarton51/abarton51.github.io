## Introduction

The Elo rating system, named after Arpad Elo, is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games. Martial arts competitions are a prime example of zero-sum games. MMA in particular has risen in popularity through various event hosting platforms such as ONE, UFC, and Bellatore. The popularity of these zero-sum games/competitions often begs the question, "Who is the greatest fighter?". More specifically, many people ask "Pound for pound, who is the greatest?".

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a full stack web scraping application that helps answer such a question using the Elo rating system. It provides a multitude of API endpoints for fetching fighter data including their Elo rating.

I utilized Scrapy for web scraping, PostgreSQL as my database technology, FastAPI to create my backend API, and React to develop the frontend. The web application is simple with little features outside of fetching the GET API endpoints currently, but it currently is just a side project to practice my skills in full stack software engineering. Right now, I am working on re-implementing the backend fully in Rust instead of Python.
