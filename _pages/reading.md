### Technical & Mathematics

All books here I have extensive experience using, but obviously such books are not a front to back type of read. For some of the books here, I have skipped large sections due to previously knowledge or just not needing the material, but I can confidently say that I read most of each book and am able to make a fair rating of the book for all practical purposes.

| _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_ | Walter Rudin | 8.9 | Real Analysis |

| _Deep Learning_ | Ian Goodfellow et al. | 8.8 | Deep Learning |
| _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ | James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, Taylor | 8.7 | Machine Learning |

## Reading Philosophy

Reading offers a unique form of engagement that differs significantly from other media. While I appreciate various forms of content consumption, books provide a depth of experience that's hard to replicate.
