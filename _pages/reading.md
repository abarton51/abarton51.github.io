### Math and Science

All books here I have extensive experience using, however, I don't feel ratings here are fair or useful for any practical purposes without a _deep_ expertise in both the fields they cover and the various texts available. 

<!--For example, I beleive it takes a Ph.D. level of knowledge and experience (up to interpretation) of real analysis, along with having read multiple books on the field such as Tao's _Analysis I_, Abbott's _Understanding Analysis_, and perhaps more, in order to review _Priciples of Mathematical Analysis_ by Rudin in any fair and substantial way.-->

These are simply the books I've used/read which I think are worthwhile.

| Book | Author | Field |
|------|---------|---------|
| _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_ | Walter Rudin | Real Analysis |
| _Complex Variables and Applications_ | James Brown, Ruel Churchill | Complex Analysis |
| _Essentials of Stochastic Processes_ | Richard Durrett | Stochastic Processes |
| _Elements of Information Theory_ | Thomas M. Cover, Joy A. Thomas | Information Theory |
| _Abstract Algebra and Its Applications_ | Various | Algebra |
| _Deep Learning_ | Ian Goodfellow et al. | Deep Learning |
| _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ | James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, Taylor | Machine Learning |
| _Probability: An Introduction_ | Geoffrey Grimmett, Dominic Welsh | Probability |
| _Applied Combinatorics_ | Mitchel T. Keller, William T. Trotter | Combinatorics |

## Rating System

- **9.5-10**: Masterpiece, life-changing
- **9.0-9.4**: Exceptional, highly recommended
- **8.5-8.9**: Excellent, very enjoyable/worthwhile
- **8.0-8.4**: Good, worth reading
