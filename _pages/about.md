**:wave: Hello!**

I am an undergraduate student veteran :mortar_board: at the Georgia Institute of Technology double majoring in:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I will be graduating in the Spring of 2025 and expect to be pursuing higher education in graduate school starting the Fall of 2025.

I have a growing passion in cybersecurity and information technology and I am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science, IT, and cybersecurity. Specifically, I am interested in vulnerability analysis and detection, anomaly detection, adversiarial machine learning, and behavior analytics. Related areas of machine learning that I find particularly interesting are nonlinear and robust dimensionality reduction.

Currently, I am planning on attending a Master of Science in Computing (or a closely related discipline) with a focus on secure computing. If you are looking for enthusiastic students or researchers in these areas feel free to contact me!

In my free time I like to train crossfit, BJJ, and Muay Thai. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.

I am a Linux user and a FOSS enthusiast. Currently my daily driver is Linux Mint. If you're interested in some of my configuration you can check out my Neovim config and dot files on my Github. After I graduate, I'll probably be switching to Arch and have been using it and experimenting through a VM in my free time. If you have suggestions on desktop environments for a daily driver laptop with no GPU please send them my way! Currently, I like the i3wm tiling window manager.
