## **:wave: Hello**

I am a graduate student :mortar_board: at Montana State University pursuing an M.S. in Cybersecurity.

I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I studied:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and data science, and am hoping to transition my studies and skills towards cybsecurity related endeavors.

I am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science, IT, and cybersecurity. Some specific interests I have are vulnerability analysis and detection, adversarial machine learning, and anomaly detection.

If you are interested in some of these topics, check out my [blog](https://austinbarton.com).

## **:mountain: Beyond Work and Studies**

In my free time I like to train crossfit, martial arts, and climbing. I love the outdoors, health and fitness, and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.
