## **:wave: Hello!**

I am an undergraduate student veteran :mortar_board: at the Georgia Institute of Technology double majoring in:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I will be graduating in the Spring of 2025 and expect to be pursuing higher education in graduate school starting the Fall of 2025.

I have a growing passion in cybersecurity and information technology and I am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science, IT, and cybersecurity. Specifically, I am interested in vulnerability analysis and detection, anomaly detection, adversiarial machine learning, and behavior analytics. Related areas of machine learning that I find particularly interesting are nonlinear and robust dimensionality reduction.

Currently, I am planning on attending a Master of Science in Computing (or a closely related discipline) with a focus on secure computing. If you are looking for enthusiastic students or researchers in these areas feel free to contact me!

In my free time I like to train crossfit, BJJ, and Muay Thai. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.

Currently, my daily driver is Linux Mint. If you're interested in some of my configuration you can check out my [Neovim config](https://github.com/abarton51/kickstart.nvim) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/abarton51/dotfiles) on my Github. I'll be switching to Arch in the near future and have been experimenting with it through VMs in my free time. If you have suggestions on desktop environments or other things for a daily driver laptop with no GPU please send them my way! Currently, I like the i3wm tiling window manager.

## Updates on What I'm Doing

- Learning Rust
  - Implementing all of my Numerical Analysis coding homeworks in Rust :crab:
- Training Crossfit
  - Focusing on building mass and increasing high intensity cardio threshold, 4-5x/week
- Training BJJ
  - Trying to focus on slowly maintaining BJJ as a discpline, 1-2x/week
- Running
  - Run enough to be able to do fun things outside, ~5 mi/week (~8km/week)
- Biking
  - Hit jumplines just enough to hit the fun trails at downhill parks like Whistler
  - Beginning a prep phase for the long backcountry trails I'll be doing this summer
- Climbing
  - Beginning phase of "refitting" for climbing, train 1-2x/week with hangboarding sessions

## Goals

- Programming
  - Become highly proficient in programming with Rust
- Fitness
  - Run 10 mi/week (16 km/week) as baseline (doesn't interfere with other activities)
- Biking:
  - Whiterim, Canyonlands, UT \| 100 mi (160 km), bikepacking
  - Whole Enchilada, Moab, UT \| 34 mi (55 km), downhill
  - Kokopelli Trail, Moab, UT \| 150 mi (240 km), bikepacking
