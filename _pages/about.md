**:wave: Hello!**

I am an undergraduate student veteran :mortar_board: at the Georgia Institute of Technology double majoring in:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I will be graduating in the Spring of 2025 and expect to be pursuing higher education in graduate school starting the Fall of 2025.

I have a growing passion in cybersecurity and am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science and cybersecurity. Specifically, I am interested in vulnerability analysis and detection, anomaly detection, adversiarial machine learning, and behavior analytics. Currently, I am planning on attending a Master of Science in Computing (or any closely related discipline) with a focus on information security. I am currently looking for a 2025 summer internship in a role closely or directly related to cybersecurity.

In my free time I like to train crossfit and BJJ. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.
