I am an undergraduate student veteran double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (CS) at Georgia Tech graduating in the Spring of 2025. I'm concentrating in data science for my major in Math and AI and IT for my major in CS. I have a growing passion in cybersecurity and am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science and cybersecurity. Specifically, I am interested in vulnerability analysis and detection, anomaly detection, adversiarial machine learning, and behavior analytics. Currently, I am planning on attending a Master of Science in Computing (or any closely related discipline) with a focus on information security. I am currently looking for a 2025 summer internship in a role closely or directly related to cybersecurity.

In my free time I look to train crossfit and BJJ. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.
