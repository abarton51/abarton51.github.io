## **:wave: Hello**

I am an undergraduate student veteran :mortar_board: at the Georgia Institute of Technology double majoring in:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I am graduating in May of 2025 and expect to be pursuing a Master's of Science in Cybersecurity (or related field) starting the Fall of 2025. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and data science, and am hoping to transition my studies and skills towards cybsecurity related endeavors. I am interested in in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science, IT, and cybersecurity. Some specific interests I have are vulnerability analysis and detection, adversarial machine learning, and anomaly detection.

_Currently finalizing graduate school commitments for Fall 2025 in Cybersecurity/Computing. Open to research and collaboration opportunities._

## **:mountain: Beyond Work and Studies**

In my free time I like to train crossfit, BJJ, and Muay Thai. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.
