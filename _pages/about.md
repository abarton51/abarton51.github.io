## **:wave: Hello!**

I am an undergraduate student veteran :mortar_board: at the Georgia Institute of Technology double majoring in:
- :pencil2: Mathematics, concentrating in Data Science :bar_chart:
- :computer: Computer Science (CS), concentrating in AI :speech_balloon: and Information Interworks :satellite:

I will be graduating in the Spring of 2025 and expect to be pursuing higher education in graduate school starting the Fall of 2025.

I will be attending a Master of Science in Computing (or a closely related discipline) with a focus on secure computing (no commitments yet). If you are looking for enthusiastic students or researchers in these areas feel free to contact me!

I am interested in researching applications and theory at the intersection of data science, IT, and cybersecurity. Specifically, vulnerability analysis and detection, anomaly detection, adversiarial machine learning, and behavior analytics.

In my free time I like to train crossfit, BJJ, and Muay Thai. I love the outdoors and sports/activities such as mountian biking, climbing, surfing, and snowboarding.
