Research experience
======
* Jan, 2024 - May, 2025: VIP Participant
  * Financial Services Innovation Lab, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA
  * Researched hawkish vs. dovish sentiment analysis via pretrained large language models on monetary policy reports from federal banks.
  * Reserached datasets for benchmarking LLMs' abilities to identify SEC violations given a scenario description.
  * Researched retrievel augmented generation (RAG) methods for knowledge intensive tasks for the financial domain.

* May, 2023 - Aug, 2023: Researcher
  * Dept. of Mathematics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC
  * Researched parameter estimation and modeling at the NSF and NSA sponsored research experience for undergraduates (REU) at NCSU.
  * Implemented Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and novel equation learning techniques in Python using PyTorch to infer a system of differential equations for an agent-based model with adaptive behavior.

Work experience
======
* May, 2024 - Aug, 2024: Software Development Engineer Intern
  * Amazon Web Services (AWS), Bellevue, WA
      * Designed, implemented, and deployed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data integration process for the Business Intelligence of an AWS service using cloud infrastructure for automated workflows, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of business metrics by integrating $\approx$35\% of previously unaccounted customer scenarios.
      * Implemented a robust dependency mocking framework, enabling the simulation of dependencies with dynamically generated test data, leading to more comprehensive integration tests.
