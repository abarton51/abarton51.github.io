## üíª My Setup

### Development Environment
Here's a peek at my current development setup that helps me stay productive. I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

*My current terminal and text editor configuration*

You can check out my [neovim](https://github.com/abarton51/kickstart.nvim) configuration or my [dotfiles](https://github.com/abarton51/dotfiles) (work in progress).

I used [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as my _kickstart_ to using Neovim. I can't recommend it for beginners enough. It's just enough to get you started, the documentation is super helpful, and it's still highly configurable and customizable.

### OS

Currently, my daily driver is Linux Mint. If you're interested in some of my configuration you can check out my [Neovim config](https://github.com/abarton51/kickstart.nvim) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/abarton51/dotfiles) on my Github. 

I want to switch Arch in the near future and have been experimenting with it through VMs in my free time. If you have suggestions on desktop environments or other things for a daily driver laptop with no GPU please send them my way! Currently, I like the i3wm tiling window manager.

## üéØ Goals

### Short Term

- Programming
  - Become highly proficient in programming with Rust
- Fitness
  - Run 10 mi/week (16 km/week) as baseline (doesn't interfere with other activities)
- Biking:
  - Whiterim, Canyonlands, UT \| 100 mi (160 km), bikepacking
  - Whole Enchilada, Moab, UT \| 34 mi (55 km), downhill
  - Kokopelli Trail, Moab, UT \| 150 mi (240 km), bikepacking
- BJJ
  - Get my blue belt
- Finance
  - Purchase a home

### Long Term

- Education
  - Start a PhD or graduate with a M.S.

## üìù Thoughts and Notes

### Fitness

I am focusing on developing the ability to _move constantly_ with _minimal recovery time_ while being *capable of high intensity*.

- Running
  - I hope to be able to run medium distances and not feel the need to recover or let it get in the way of other more strenuous activities like BJJ, climbing, biking, etc.

- Lifting and Crossfit
  - I hope to be capable of outputting high intensity with high power for a variety of movement.
  - I used to powerlift and bodybuild but it just wasn't the optimal training method for all of the other sports and activities I do.

### Reading

Reading books has a strikingly distinct affect on one's mind. The experience in comparison to visual media is remarkably different. Additionally, reading a book for the purpose of pleasure is also distinct from reading text for a job, class, or to learn a skill.

I've come to acknowledge just how important and beneficial reading can be, even if I'd rather watch YouTube or a good movie.

This isn't to say YouTube videos and cinema don't have their place or are inferior to books. I just think they are every different and serve different purposes.
